I am a third year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"}, supervised by [William Fefferman](http://www.billfefferman.com){:target="_blank"}.

Previously, from 2018 to 2020, I was a Master's student at the University of Waterloo, under the brilliant supervision of [John Watrous](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/){:target="_blank"}. I was also a part of the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/){:target="_blank"} (IQC). 

In another life, I was an undergraduate at [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in){:target="_blank"}, India in the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, from 2014 to 2018.

Here is my [curriculum vitae](/files/CV.pdf).

### Research Interests 

I have broad interests in **quantum computing**. Specific topics that I am interested in include **quantum complexity theory**, **quantum algorithms**, **near term quantum computation**, and **quantum cryptography**. I am also interested in **algorithms**, **complexity theory**, and **theoretical computer science** more generally.

### Outreach

I am a part of ["bigyan"](https://bigyan.org.in){:target="_blank"}, a science outreach group that aims to popularize science in the Bengali language. Please feel free to message me on any social media platform or send me an email if you are interested in contributing to "bigyan" or discussing science outreach more generally.
